      <p>You, heavy user of the web. We need your help. We're getting too many emails, working with too many files, collecting information over the web too often, to ignore our pains. Let us show you what we mean.</p>

      <p>We want to solve the problem of research contexts being very inaccessible constructs are not easy to use. We create apps that work with '.research' documents, where every aspect of the interaction has been designed around the idea of research topics as a first-class entity. This is all too complicated in writing, so again, a video.</p>

      <p>We've been at this since 2010, and the inception of the design goes back a few more years. As a startup without external funding, the last few years we've been learning how challenging it is to pull this kind of thing off. I mean, even software companies with excellent focus and track record in design, such as Apple, can take a while to get something right. If you've done this, you know how tough this is.</p>
      
      <p>That's why we want to reach out to everyone to help us. We're fundraising, and it's its own [little experiment in lean startup]. It would be awesome if you could [help us out]. There's a ton of easy ones, take a look.</p>
